# Planning Story

This project was executed with Create React App and real-time messaging capabilities via Socket.io. React.js was implemented to build a dynamic user interface and client-side features on the website. Styling was implemented with CSS and Bootstrap. Wire Frames and ERDs were created as a first step to conceptualize the application, followed by a Kanban board to assign and track tasks.
