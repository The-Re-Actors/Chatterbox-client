## Planning Story

This project was developed using Create React App and incorporates real-time messaging capabilities through Socket.io. React.js was utilized to create a dynamic user interface and client-side features. The website's styling was implemented using CSS and Bootstrap. The initial steps of the project involved creating wireframes and ERDs to conceptualize the application's structure. A Kanban board was then used to assign and track tasks throughout the development process.
